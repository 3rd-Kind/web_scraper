# web_scraper
A web scraper made in 2024

When running you will need to download various selenium modules along with, requests, os.

If you want to use on your system, please change the empty path variable to where you want to store the files. Use two backspaces. E.G path = "C:\\Users\Username\\OneDrive\\Desktop"

Not all images can be scraped using this scraper as some error's are thrown, i am abit unfamiliar with python, as i gather a greater understanding of python i will be able to update this code to provide more comprehensive scraping.

Enjoy.
